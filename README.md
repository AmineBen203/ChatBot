# ChatBot 

## Overview
This is a simple chatbot application created using WinForms in C#. The chatbot simulates a conversation between a user and a bot, where the user can type messages, and the bot responds with pre-configured or dynamically generated responses. The bot also shows a "typing..." animation while waiting for a response.
